After unzipping the entire project, unzip the CFG archive again and copy the folder to your CFG folder, then rename it to Sqaure. Please note that the Sqaure folder is the root directory. You should end up with the following structure:...\game\csgo\cfg\Sqaure\Setup.cfg
If this is your first time using this CFG to complete the aforementioned operation, run GetCpuInfo; otherwise, the game will not start!  Once GetCpuInfo displays no errors and prompts you to close the program, you can proceed to the next step
Run OpenConfigSettingFolder, and the program will open a folder for you. Open and configure the two files, KeyBinds.cfg and Setting.cfg, with a text editor and save them!  You need to make settings according to your preferences inside.
Add the startup item +exec Sqaure/Setup, or simply fill in exec Sqaure/setup in autoexec.cfg
This CFG is currently incompatible with other CFGs. Please exercise caution when using other CFGs. Before loading this CFG, please ensure that you have deleted any third-party CFGs and reset game keys, etc
